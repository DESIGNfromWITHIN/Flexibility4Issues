Flexibility - version 0.0.1-rc
http://flexibilitymodx.com/

Flexibility - Fully functional MODX Revolution website.
Quickstart projects by creating a fully working MODX Revolution website with just one package! Flexibility includes navigation, search, blog, client setting, templates, template variables and more.

This package is meant to be used once to quick-start MODX website projects. It will install a lot of things and provide a nice responsive MODX website based on the Foundation framework from ZURB.

!!! ATTENTION !!!
----------------------------

- If you change or edit any Chunk, Snippet, Template Variable or Plugin that was included in the Flexibility package, please rename it! Or it will be overwritten on any future updates.
- Any needed packages (like Wayfinder) will be installed automatically by the Flexibility package. You will be able to update and edit any sub-packages at a later date.
